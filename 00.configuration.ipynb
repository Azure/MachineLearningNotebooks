    "### 1. Install Azure ML SDK\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. Install some additional packages\n",
    "This Notebook requires some additional libraries. In the conda environment, run below commands: \n",
    "```shell\n",
    "(myenv) $ conda install -y matplotlib tqdm scikit-learn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Make sure your subscription is registered to use ACI.\n",
    "This Notebook makes use of Azure Container Instance (ACI). You need to ensure your subscription has been registered to use ACI in order be able to deploy a dev/test web service.\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "# check to see if ACI is already registered\n",
    "(myenv) $ az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerInstance -o table\n",

    "# note you need to be the subscription owner in order to execute this command successfully.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example you will optionally create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace and initialize your notebook directory to easily use this workspace.  Typically you will only need to run this once per notebook directory, and all other notebooks in this directory or any sub-directories will automatically use the settings you indicate here.\n",

    "An AML Workspace is an Azure resource that organaizes and coordinates the actions of many other Azure resources to assist in executing and sharing machine learning workflows.  In particular, an AML Workspace coordinates storage, databases, and compute resources providing added functionality for machine learning experimentation, operationalization, and the monitoring of operationalized models.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to use an AML Workspace, first you need access to an Azure Subscription.  You can [create your own](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or get your existing subscription information from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).  Inside your subscription, you will need access to a _resource group_, which organizes Azure resources and provides a default region for the resources in a group.  You can see what resource groups to which you have access, or create a new one in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)\n",

    "* Your subscription id\n",
    "* The resource group name\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: As with other Azure services, there are limits on certain resources (for eg. BatchAI cluster size) associated with the Azure Machine Learning service. Please read [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-manage-quotas) on the default limits and how to request more quota."
