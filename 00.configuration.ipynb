    "\n",

    "In this example you will optionally create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace and initialize your notebook directory to easily use this workspace.

Inside your subscription, you will need access to a _resource group_, which organizes Azure resources and provides a default region for the resources in a group.  You can see what resource groups to which you have access, or create a new one in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)\n",
