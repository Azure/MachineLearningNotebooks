    "This tutorial shows how to train a simple deep neural network using the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow on Azure Machine Learning. MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a handwritten digit of `28x28` pixels, representing number from 0 to 9. The goal is to create a multi-class classifier to identify the digit each image represents, and deploy it as a web service in Azure.\n",
