## Employee Development Career Plan

### 3I
#### Investigate
**1.  Knowing yourself**

The first step in planning your career is evaluating and understanding your aspirations; strengths; interests; drivers, and other influences. For an objective assessment, seek guidance from others as well. Please indicate which aspects of the planning process you have evaluated. This guides the Engineer Manager in the right direction to create opportunities for individuals to grow.
- Key Strengths
- Technical Skills
- Work / Life Values
- Key Fields of Interest
- Fields that I am not interested in

**2. Where do you want to go next?**

- What does my ideal job or career progression look like?
- Transfer Options?
- Where do I want to be in the next five years?
- Why is this important to me? This is a list of why you feel this is important.  Why does it matter? Why does it make you happy?

**3. How can you get there?**

- What new skills, knowledge do I need to possess?  What new skills do I want to learn?
Look at the next level on GitLab Career Progressions
-  Where you would like to go.  What new skills do you need to take you to the next level (box) in the career progression? What existing skills do I need to develop?
This would be the place to list skills that you currently have but need to fine tune or improve to consider yourself an expert.
- How can I commit to achieving my goals?
What specific tasks can you complete to reach the goals?  What is necessary to develop the skills in the row above?
- How will I know I have been successful?
- Identify success metrics  based on the goals documented above.

#### Identify SMART Goals

- **S**pecific (so you know exactly what you are trying to achieve)
-  **M**easurable (so you know when you have achieved it!)
-  **A**ction-oriented (so you can DO something about it!)
-  **R**ealistic (so it IS achievable) and
- **T**ime-Bound (has a deadline)

| SMART Goal | Complete By| How can success/completion be measured?|
| ------- |  ------ | ------ |
| | |  |


#### Implement
Implement goals by creating issues to meet the SMART goals identified.  Labels will be created that map to the Career Matrix so that meaningful Issue Boards can be created.

| SMART Goal | Issue(s) |
| ------ | ------ |
