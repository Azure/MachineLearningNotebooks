Our priorities should follow [overall guidance for Product](/handbook/product/product-processes/#how-we-prioritize-work). This should be reflected in the priority label for scheduled issues:

| Priority | Description | Probability of shipping in milestone |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| priority::1 | **Urgent**: top priority for achieving in the given milestone. These issues are the most important goals for a release and should be worked on first; some may be time-critical or unblock dependencies. | ~100% |
| priority::2 | **High**: important issues that have significant positive impact to the business or technical debt. Important, but not time-critical or blocking others.  | ~75% |
| priority::3 | **Normal**: incremental improvements to existing features. These are important iterations, but deemed non-critical. | ~50% |
| priority::4 | **Low**: stretch issues that are acceptable to postpone into a future release. | ~25% |
