Welcome to the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK notebooks repository!

## Getting started

These notebooks are recommended for use in an Azure Machine Learning [Compute Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-instance), where you can run them without any additional set up.

However, the notebooks can be run in any development environment with the correct `azureml` packages installed.

Install the `azureml.core` Python package:

```sh
pip install azureml-core
```

Install additional packages as needed:

```sh
pip install azureml-mlflow
pip install azureml-dataset-runtime
pip install azureml-automl-runtime
pip install azureml-pipeline
pip install azureml-pipeline-steps
...
```

We recommend starting with one of the [quickstarts](tutorials/compute-instance-quickstarts).
