# Azure Machine Learning service example notebooks

This repository contains example notebooks demonstrating the [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning-service/) Python SDK which allows you to build, train, deploy and manage machine learning solutions using Azure.  The AML SDK allows you the choice of using local or cloud compute resources, while managing and maintaining the complete data science workflow from the cloud.

## Quick installation
```sh
pip install azureml-sdk
```
Read more detailed instructions on [how to set up your environment](./NBSETUP.md) using Azure Notebook service, your own Jupyter notebook server, or Docker.

## How to navigate and use the example notebooks?
If you are using an Azure Machine Learning Notebook VM, you are all set. Otherwise, you should always run the [Configuration](./configuration.ipynb) notebook first when setting up a notebook library on a new machine or in a new environment. It configures your notebook library to connect to an Azure Machine Learning workspace, and sets up your workspace and compute to be used by many of the other examples. 
This [index](./index.md) should assist in navigating the Azure Machine Learning notebook samples and encourage efficient retrieval of topics and content. 

If you want to...

 * ...try out and explore Azure ML, start with image classification tutorials: [Part 1 (Training)](./tutorials/image-classification-mnist-data/img-classification-part1-training.ipynb) and [Part 2 (Deployment)](./tutorials/image-classification-mnist-data/img-classification-part2-deploy.ipynb).
 * ...learn about experimentation and tracking run history, first [train within Notebook](./how-to-use-azureml/training/train-within-notebook/train-within-notebook.ipynb), then try [training on remote VM](./how-to-use-azureml/training/train-on-remote-vm/train-on-remote-vm.ipynb) and [using logging APIs](./how-to-use-azureml/training/logging-api/logging-api.ipynb).
 * ...train deep learning models at scale, first learn about [Machine Learning Compute](./how-to-use-azureml/training/train-on-amlcompute/train-on-amlcompute.ipynb), and then try [distributed hyperparameter tuning](./how-to-use-azureml/training-with-deep-learning/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-pytorch/train-hyperparameter-tune-deploy-with-pytorch.ipynb) and [distributed training](./how-to-use-azureml/training-with-deep-learning/distributed-pytorch-with-horovod/distributed-pytorch-with-horovod.ipynb).
 * ...deploy models as a realtime scoring service, first learn the basics by [training within Notebook and deploying to Azure Container Instance](./how-to-use-azureml/training/train-within-notebook/train-within-notebook.ipynb), then learn how to [production deploy models on Azure Kubernetes Cluster](./how-to-use-azureml/deployment/production-deploy-to-aks/production-deploy-to-aks.ipynb).
 * ...deploy models as a batch scoring service, first [train a model within Notebook](./how-to-use-azureml/training/train-within-notebook/train-within-notebook.ipynb), then [create Machine Learning Compute for scoring compute](./how-to-use-azureml/training/train-on-amlcompute/train-on-amlcompute.ipynb), and [use Machine Learning Pipelines to deploy your model](https://aka.ms/pl-batch-scoring).
 * ...monitor your deployed models, learn about using [App Insights](./how-to-use-azureml/deployment/enable-app-insights-in-production-service/enable-app-insights-in-production-service.ipynb).
