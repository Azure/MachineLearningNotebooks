Calendars are used to communicate important events:

- **Personal Calendar**
   - Communicate your daily work schedule. Setting your daily work hours in Google Calendar helps communicate your availability to team members across timezones.  This is important when scheduling synchronous meetings across timezones.  (Making your calendar public is recommended but it is not required.)
   - Communicate activities / events you plan on attending
- **Group Calendar**
   - Communicate feature related events (Deep Dives, Demonstrations etc.)
   - Communicate weekly group meetings (all stable counterparts are invited)
- **Sprint Planning Calendar**
   - communicate deadlines for Sprint Planning activities
