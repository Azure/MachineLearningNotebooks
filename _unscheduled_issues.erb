Everyone at GitLab has the freedom to manage their work as they see fit,
because [we measure results, not hours](/handbook/values/#measure-results-not-hours). Part of this is the
opportunity to work on items that aren't scheduled as part of the
regular monthly release. This is mostly a reiteration of items elsewhere
in the handbook, and it is here to make those explicit:

1. We expect people to be [managers of one](/handbook/values/#managers-of-one), and we [use
   GitLab ourselves](/handbook/values/#dogfooding). If you see something that you think
   is important, you can request for it to be scheduled, or you can
   [work on a proposal yourself](/handbook/values/#dont-wait), _as long as you keep your
   other priorities in mind_.
2. From time to time, there are events that GitLab team-members can participate
   in, like the [issue bash](https://about.gitlab.com/community/issue-bash/). Anyone is welcome
   to participate in these.

When you pick something to work on, please:

1. Follow the standard workflow and assign it to yourself.
2. Share it in `#s_manage` to encourage [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency)
