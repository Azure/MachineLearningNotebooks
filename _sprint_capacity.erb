The Engineering Manager (EM) creates a Sprint Planning Google Doc for each Backend Engineer (BE) to collaborate during Sprint Planning.  The BE enters their capacity for the Sprint.

- Each team member begins each Sprint with a capacity of 184 hours (which translates to a weight of 10) for each BE
- Each team member should reduce their capacity based on the hours they will be Out of the Office (OOO) for the Sprint
- Each team member should reduce their capacity based on hours they will be working on activities outside of the Sprint Release Board
   -  Examples include working on Deep Dives, Training, Conferences, Interviews, Code Reviews, Backend Maintainers, etc.
