        "This notebook shows how to use [Fairlearn (an open source fairness assessment and unfairness mitigation package)](http://fairlearn.github.io) and Azure Machine Learning Studio for a binary classification problem. This example uses the well-known adult census dataset. For the purposes of this notebook, we shall treat this as a loan decision problem. We will pretend that the label indicates whether or not each individual repaid a loan in the past. We will use the data to train a predictor to predict whether previously unseen individuals will repay a loan or not. The assumption is that the model predictions are used to decide whether an individual should be offered a loan. Its purpose is purely illustrative of a workflow including a fairness dashboard - in particular, we do **not** include a full discussion of the detailed issues which arise when considering fairness in machine learning. For such discussions, please [refer to the Fairlearn website](http://fairlearn.github.io/).\n",
        "\n",
        "We will apply the [grid search algorithm](https://fairlearn.github.io/master/api_reference/fairlearn.reductions.html#fairlearn.reductions.GridSearch) from the Fairlearn package using a specific notion of fairness called Demographic Parity. This produces a set of models, and we will view these in a dashboard both locally and in the Azure Machine Learning Studio.\n",
