        "In this notebook, we walk through a simple example of using the `azureml-contrib-fairness` package to upload a collection of fairness statistics for a fairness dashboard. It is an example of integrating the [open source Fairlearn package](https://www.github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn) with Azure Machine Learning. This is not an example of fairness analysis or mitigation - this notebook simply shows how to get a fairness dashboard into the Azure Machine Learning portal. We will load the data and train a couple of simple models. We will then use Fairlearn to generate data for a Fairness dashboard, which we can upload to Azure Machine Learning portal and view there.\n",
