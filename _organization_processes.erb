Organization works on components of the application that have a far-reaching impact and many groups will be involved in migratig features over, the following process is needed:

* Infradev and performance issues must be triaged by the EM and PM to determine their priority based on the impact of the number of users affected and how severe the problem is.
* Large scale projects (over 3 months of work) and mid-size projects (spanning over 1 milestone of planned work) will be organized in epics with clear iteration plans.
* The epic must be broken down by the engineers to enable external contributors from other teams to easily identify what needs to be picked up.
* S1 security issues will be picked up by the team immediately (per [security process](/handbook/security/threat-management/vulnerability-management/#remediation-slas)).
* S2 security issues will be picked up in the closest upcoming milestone.
