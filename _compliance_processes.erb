#### Include a "Require separate implementation issues" section

The Compliance group would like to include an experimental section in issue descriptions. The section gives the author the opportunity to specify whether or not an issue requires subsequent implementation issues.
￼
In previous milestones, we've found that it's easy to miss linked implementation issues. In most cases, less complex issues already have a detailed implementation plan. In other cases, there may be links to follow-up issues. Other issues may be promoted to epics with the issues contained within the epic.
￼
We think that a dedicated section in issue descriptions, such as the following, would help:

```
### Does this issue require subsequent implementation issues?

Yes/No
```
