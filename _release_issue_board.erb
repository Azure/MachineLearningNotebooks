This is the first activity that occurs for a Sprint. Sprint Planning begins in the previous Sprint. This ensures that the team can start working on Issues that have been weighted and clearly defined by Day 1 of the Sprint.

The Product Manager (PM) begins the process by moving items out of the Backlog and adding them to a Release (Milestone). Labels are created for each Milestone.  The output of this process is a Release Issue Board.

Once the PM creates the Release Issue Board, the EM adds the issues to each BE's Sprint Planning Google Doc. The Backend Engineers:

- Add a weight to each issue in the Sprint Planning Google Doc
- Add an explanation for why the assigned the weight in the Sprint Planning Google Doc
- Update the issue in GitLab with ideas, questions, and areas of concerns

Once all of the Backend Engineers have completed their Sprint Planning, the EM consolidates all of their responses into a shared Team Sprint Planning Google Doc.  The EM reviews all of the weights and explanations and determines a final weight for each issue. In some instances, Backend Engineers  assign different weights for the same  issue.  In this scenario, the EM will analyze their explanations and assign the final weight.
