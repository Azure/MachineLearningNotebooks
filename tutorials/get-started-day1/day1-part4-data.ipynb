    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous [Tutorial: Train a model in the cloud](day1-part3-train-model.ipynb) article, the CIFAR10 data was downloaded using the inbuilt `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10` method in the PyTorch API. However, in many cases you are going to want to use your own data in a remote training run. This article focuses on the workflow you can leverage such that you can work with your own data in Azure Machine Learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you would have a better understanding of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to upload your data to Azure\n",
    "- Best practices for working with cloud data in Azure Machine Learning\n",
    "- Working with command-line arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows the steps provided on the [Python (day 1) - bring your own data documentation page](https://aka.ms/day1aml).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You have completed:\n",
    "  - Setup on your [Azure Machine Learning Compute Cluster](day1-part1-setup.ipynb)\n",

    "  - [Tutorial: Train a model in the cloud](day1-part3-train-model.ipynb)\n",
    "- Familiarity with Python and Machine Learning concepts\n",
    "- If you are using a compute instance in Azure Machine Learning to run this notebook series, you are all set. Otherwise, please follow the [Configure a development environment for Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-configure-environment)\n",

    "Presently our training script is set to download the CIFAR10 dataset on each run. The python code in [code/pytorch-cifar10-your-data/train.py](code/pytorch-cifar10-your-data/train.py) now uses **`argparse` to parametize the script.**"
