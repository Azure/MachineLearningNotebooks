    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the [previous tutorial](day1-part2-hello-world.ipynb), you ran a trivial \"Hello world!\" script in the cloud using Azure Machine Learning's Python SDK. This time you take it a step further by submitting a script that will train a machine learning model. This example will help you understand how Azure Machine Learning eases consistent behavior between debugging on a compute instance or laptop development environment, and remote runs.\n",

    "Learning these concepts means that by the end of this session, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use Conda to define an Azure Machine Learning environment.\n",
    "* Train a model in the cloud.\n",
    "* Log metrics to Azure Machine Learning.\n",

    "- Familiarity with Python and Machine Learning concepts\n",
