    "- Running Python code in the cloud with Azure Machine Learning SDK\n",
    "- Switching between debugging locally on a compute instance.\n",

This tutorial is part of a **four-part tutorial series** in which you learn the fundamentals of Azure Machine Learning and complete simple jobs-based machine learning tasks in the Azure cloud. It builds off the work you completed in [Tutorial part 1: set up an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster](day1-part1-setup.ipynb).\n",
