        "In this tutorial, you use Azure Machine Learning service pipelines to run a batch scoring image classification job. The example job uses the pre-trained [Inception-V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) CNN (convolutional neural network) Tensorflow model to classify unlabeled images. Machine learning pipelines optimize your workflow with speed, portability, and reuse so you can focus on your expertise, machine learning, rather than on infrastructure and automation. After building and publishing a pipeline, you can configure a REST endpoint to enable triggering the pipeline from any HTTP library on any platform.\n",
