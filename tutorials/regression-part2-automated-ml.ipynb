        "Now you're ready to start building your model with Azure Machine Learning service. In this part of the tutorial, you use the prepared data and automatically generate a regression model to predict taxi fare prices. By using the automated machine learning capabilities of the service, you define your machine learning goals and constraints. You launch the automated machine learning process. Then allow the algorithm selection and hyperparameter tuning to happen for you. The automated machine learning technique iterates over many combinations of algorithms and hyperparameters until it finds the best model based on your criterion.\n",

The traditional machine learning model development process is highly resource-intensive, and requires significant domain knowledge and time investment to run and compare the results of dozens of models. Using automated machine learning is a great way to rapidly test many different models for your scenario."
