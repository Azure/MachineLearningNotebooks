You'll use the training and deployment workflow for Azure Machine Learning service (preview) in a Python Jupyter notebook.

MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a handwritten digit of 28x28 pixels, representing a number from 0 to 9. The goal is to create a multi-class classifier to identify the digit a given image represents. \n",
