Each week, the Product Manager, the Create:IDE Frontend and Create:IDE Backend Teams conduct a synchronous meeting to share progress and discuss issues. These meetings are recorded and can be viewed asynchronously.  A Google Doc is also available to ask questions or comment synchronous or asynchronously. Conducting meetings using this format allows all team members to participate in knowledge sharing.
