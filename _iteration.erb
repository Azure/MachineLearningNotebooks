[iteration]: /handbook/values/#iteration

[Iteration][iteration] is everyone's responsibility and it should be performed throughout the development lifecycle.  PM and UX iterate as they are developing the product requirements and designs. The Engineering Teams pick up the work and then doing the following:

 * Backlog Refinement
     * Review the issues in Backlog
     * Collaborate with peers
     * Weight issues

* Create MRs for the Issues

* Submit MRs for Code Review

**Iteration during Backlog Refinement**

1. If there are issues that appear to be so large that they will span multiple Milestones, create **Epics** instead.
2. If the MR breakdown for an issue breaks down into five or more MRs, the issue is too large, try to split the issues into multiple issues. 
3. If an issue weight is five or higher, split the issue into multiple issues.

**Iteration during creation of the MRs**

While working on an MR, sometimes additional work is discovered.  When additional work is discovered, ask the following questions:

1. Should this **new work** be implemented in a new MR?
2. Should this **new work** be implemented in a new Issue?
3. Can the current Issue be completed without this **new work**?


**Iteration during the Code Review**

During the Code Review,  maintainer(s) will make recommendations. For each code review comment:
1. Did the maintainer specifically stated their review comments are non blocking? If so, create a separate issue, add to backlog and @ mention your EM and PM.
2. Ask the maintainer if this change is a non blocking comment? If so, create a separate issue, add to backlog and @ mention your EM and PM.
3. Is the feedback a significant code refactor (the refactor would take longer than the time you originally estimated for this issue)?  If so, can you create a separate issue for the refactor.
