## Use MLflow with Azure Machine Learning service (Preview)

[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) is an open-source platform for tracking machine learning experiments and managing models. You can use MLflow logging APIs with Azure Machine Learning service: the metrics and artifacts are logged to your Azure ML Workspace.

Try out the sample notebooks:

* [Use MLflow with Azure Machine Learning for Local Training Run](./train-local/train-local.ipynb)
* [Use MLflow with Azure Machine Learning for Remote Training Run](./train-remote/train-remote.ipynb)
* [Deploy Model as Azure Machine Learning Web Service using MLflow](./deploy-model/deploy-model.ipynb)
* [Train and Deploy PyTorch Image Classifier](./train-deploy-pytorch/train-deploy-pytorch.ipynb)
