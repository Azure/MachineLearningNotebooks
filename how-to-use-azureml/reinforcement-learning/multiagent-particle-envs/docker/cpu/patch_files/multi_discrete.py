    - The multi-discrete action space consists of a series of discrete action spaces with different
      parameters
    - It can be adapted to both a Discrete action space or a continuous (Box) action space
    - It is useful to represent game controllers or keyboards where each key can be represented as
      a discrete action space
    - It is parametrized by passing an array of arrays containing [min, max] for each discrete action
      space where the discrete action space can take any integers from `min` to `max` (both inclusive)
    Note: A value of 0 always need to represent the NOOP action.
    e.g. Nintendo Game Controller
    - Can be conceptualized as 3 discrete action spaces:
        1) Arrow Keys: Discrete 5  - NOOP[0], UP[1], RIGHT[2], DOWN[3], LEFT[4]  - params: min: 0, max: 4
        2) Button A:   Discrete 2  - NOOP[0], Pressed[1] - params: min: 0, max: 1
        3) Button B:   Discrete 2  - NOOP[0], Pressed[1] - params: min: 0, max: 1
    - Can be initialized as
        MultiDiscrete([ [0,4], [0,1], [0,1] ])
