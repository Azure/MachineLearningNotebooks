# Azure Machine Learning datasets (preview)

Azure Machine Learning datasets (preview) let data scientists and machine learning engineers apply data for ML with confidence. By creating a dataset, you create a reference to the data source location, along with a copy of its metadata. The data remains in its existing location, so no extra storage cost is incurred.

With Azure Machine Learning datasets, you can: 

* **Keep a single copy of data in your storage** referenced by datasets. 

* **Easily access data during model training** without worrying about connection string or data path.

* **Share data & collaborate** with other users.

## Learn how to use Azure Machine Learning datasets:
