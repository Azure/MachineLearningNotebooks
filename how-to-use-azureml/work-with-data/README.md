# Work With Data Using Azure Machine Learning Service

Azure Machine Learning Datasets (preview) make it easier to access and work with your data. Datasets manage data in various scenarios such as model training and pipeline creation. Using the Azure Machine Learning SDK, you can access underlying storage, explore and prepare data, manage the life cycle of different Dataset definitions, and compare between Datasets used in training and in production.

- For an example of using Datasets, see the [sample](datasets).
- For advanced data preparation examples, see [dataprep](dataprep).
