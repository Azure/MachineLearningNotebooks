All we are trying to do in this section is to identify situations when the variable contains the strong auto-regressive components that needs to be included in the model to improve forecast accuracy. </li>\n",

    "        <li> When describing the ACF we essentially running a regression between a partigular lag of a series, say, lag 4, and the series itself. What this implies is the regression coefficient for lag 4 captures the impact of everything that happens in lags 1, 2 and 3. In other words, if lag 1 is the most important lag and we exclude it from the regression, naturally, the regression model will assign the importance of the 1st lag to the 4th one. Partial auto-correlation function fixes this problem since it measures the contribution of each lag accounting for the information added by the intermediary lags. If we were to illustrate ACF and PACF for the fourth lag using the regression analogy, the difference is a follows: \n",

However, the PACF plot shows that the partial autocorrealtion coefficient is zero (from a statistical point of view since it lies within the shaded region). This is happening because the 1st and 2nd lags are good predictors of the target variable.
