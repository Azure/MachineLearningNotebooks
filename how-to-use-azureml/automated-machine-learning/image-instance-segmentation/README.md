# Instance Segmentation using AutoML for Images
- Dataset: Toy dataset with images of products found in a fridge
    - **[Jupyter Notebook](auto-ml-image-instance-segmentation.ipynb)**
        - train an Instance Segmentation model using AutoML
        - tune hyperparameters of the model to optimize model performance
        - deploy the model to use in inference scenarios
