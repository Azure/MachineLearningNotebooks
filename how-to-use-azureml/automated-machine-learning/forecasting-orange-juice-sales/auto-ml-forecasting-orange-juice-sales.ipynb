        "For forecasting tasks, there are some additional parameters that can be set: the name of the column holding the date/time, the grain column names, and the maximum forecast horizon. A time column is required for forecasting, while the grain is optional. If a grain is not given, AutoML assumes that the whole dataset is a single time-series. We also pass a list of columns to drop prior to modeling. The _logQuantity_ column is completely correlated with the target quantity, so it must be removed to prevent a target leak.\n",

        "The forecast horizon is given in units of the time-series frequency; for instance, the OJ series frequency is weekly, so a horizon of 20 means that a trained model will estimate sales up to 20 weeks beyond the latest date in the training data for each series. In this example, we set the maximum horizon to the number of samples per series in the test set (n_test_periods). Generally, the value of this parameter will be dictated by business needs. For example, a demand planning organizaion that needs to estimate the next month of sales would set the horizon accordingly. Please see the [energy_demand notebook](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/tree/master/how-to-use-azureml/automated-machine-learning/forecasting-energy-demand) for more discussion of forecast horizon.\n",

AutoML uses out-of-sample error estimates to select a best pipeline/model, so it is important that the CV fold splitting is done correctly. Time-series can violate the basic statistical assumptions of the canonical K-Fold CV strategy, so AutoML implements a [rolling origin validation](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/) procedure to create CV folds for time-series data. To use this procedure, you just need to specify the desired number of CV folds in the AutoMLConfig object.
