This customization can be used for the scenario that our customers know which imputation methods fit best to the input data.

A time column is required for forecasting, while the time_series_id is optional. If time_series_id columns are not given, AutoML assumes that the whole dataset is a single time-series.

In this example, we set the forecast horizon to the number of samples per series in the test set (n_test_periods). Generally, the value of this parameter will be dictated by business needs. For example, a demand planning application that estimates the next month of sales should set the horizon according to suitable planning time-scales.

        "In the first case, AutoML loops over all time-series in your dataset and trains one model (e.g. AutoArima or Prophet, as the case may be) for each series. This can result in long runtimes to train these models if there are a lot of series in the data. One way to mitigate this problem is to fit models for different series in parallel if you have multiple compute cores available. To enable this behavior, set the `max_cores_per_iteration` parameter in your AutoMLConfig as shown in the example in the next cell. \n",

        "Finally, a note about the cross-validation (CV) procedure for time-series data. AutoML uses out-of-sample error estimates to select a best pipeline/model, so it is important that the CV fold splitting is done correctly. Time-series can violate the basic statistical assumptions of the canonical K-Fold CV strategy, so AutoML implements a [rolling origin validation](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/) procedure to create CV folds for time-series data. To use this procedure, you could specify the desired number of CV folds and the number of periods between two consecutive folds in the AutoMLConfig object, or AutoMl could set them automatically if you don't specify them. It is also possible to bypass CV and use your own validation set by setting the *validation_data* parameter of AutoMLConfig.\n",
