        "For forecasting tasks, there are some additional parameters that can be set: the name of the column holding the date/time, the grain column names, and the maximum forecast horizon. A time column is required for forecasting, while the grain is optional. If a grain is not given, AutoML assumes that the whole dataset is a single time-series. We also pass a list of columns to drop prior to modeling. The _logQuantity_ column is completely correlated with the target quantity, so it must be removed to prevent a target leak.\n",

In this example, we set the maximum horizon to the number of samples per series in the test set (n_test_periods). Generally, the value of this parameter will be dictated by business needs. For example, a demand planning organizaion that needs to estimate the next month of sales would set the horizon accordingly.

AutoML uses out-of-sample error estimates to select a best pipeline/model, so it is important that the CV fold splitting is done correctly. Time-series can violate the basic statistical assumptions of the canonical K-Fold CV strategy, so AutoML implements a [rolling origin validation](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/tscv/) procedure to create CV folds for time-series data. To use this procedure, you just need to specify the desired number of CV folds in the AutoMLConfig object.
