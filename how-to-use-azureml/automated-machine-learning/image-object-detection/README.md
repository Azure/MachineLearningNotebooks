# Object Detection using AutoML for Images
- Dataset: Toy dataset with images of products found in a fridge
    - **[Jupyter Notebook](auto-ml-image-object-detection.ipynb)**
        - train an Object Detection model using AutoML
        - tune hyperparameters of the model to optimize model performance
        - deploy the model to use in inference scenarios
