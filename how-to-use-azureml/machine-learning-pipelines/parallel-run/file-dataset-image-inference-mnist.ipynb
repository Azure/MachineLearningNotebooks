        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to make predictions on large quantities of data asynchronously using the ML pipelines with Azure Machine Learning. Batch inference (or batch scoring) provides cost-effective inference, with unparalleled throughput for asynchronous applications. Batch prediction pipelines can scale to perform inference on terabytes of production data. Batch prediction is optimized for high throughput, fire-and-forget predictions for a large collection of data.\n",

        "If your system requires low-latency processing (to process a single document or small set of documents quickly), use [real-time scoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/v1/how-to-consume-web-service) instead of batch prediction.\n",
