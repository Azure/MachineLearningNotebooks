ONNX enables open and interoperable AI by enabling data scientists and developers to use the tools of their choice without worrying about lock-in and flexibility to deploy to a variety of platforms. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners including Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon. For more information, explore the [ONNX website](http://onnx.ai).\n",

Each image is a handwritten digit of 28x28 pixels, representing numbers from 0 to 9. For more information about the MNIST dataset, please visit [Yan LeCun's website](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). For more information about the MNIST model and how it was created can be found on the [ONNX Model Zoo github](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/master/vision/classification/mnist). "
