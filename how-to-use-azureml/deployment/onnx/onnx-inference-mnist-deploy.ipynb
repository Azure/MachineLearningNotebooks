        "This example shows how to deploy an image classification neural network using the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology ([MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)) dataset and Open Neural Network eXchange format ([ONNX](http://aka.ms/onnxdocarticle)) on the Azure Machine Learning platform. MNIST is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 grayscale images. Each image is a handwritten digit of 28x28 pixels, representing number from 0 to 9. This tutorial will show you how to deploy a MNIST model from the [ONNX model zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models), use it to make predictions using ONNX Runtime Inference, and deploy it as a web service in Azure.\n",

With ONNX, AI developers can more easily move models between state-of-the-art tools (CNTK, PyTorch, Caffe, MXNet, TensorFlow) and choose the combination that is best for them. ONNX is developed and supported by a community of partners including Microsoft AI, Facebook, and Amazon. For more information, explore the [ONNX website](http://onnx.ai) and [open source files](https://github.com/onnx).\n",

        "A [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN, or ConvNet) is a type of [feed-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) artificial neural network made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. The CNNs take advantage of the spatial nature of the data. In nature, we perceive different objects by their shapes, size and colors. For example, objects in a natural scene are typically edges, corners/vertices (defined by two of more edges), color patches etc. These primitives are often identified using different detectors (e.g., edge detection, color detector) or combination of detectors interacting to facilitate image interpretation (object classification, region of interest detection, scene description etc.) in real world vision related tasks. These detectors are also known as filters. Convolution is a mathematical operator that takes an image and a filter as input and produces a filtered output (representing say edges, corners, or colors in the input image).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Historically, these filters are a set of weights that were often hand crafted or modeled with mathematical functions (e.g., [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter) / [Laplacian](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/log.htm) / [Canny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) filter).  The filter outputs are mapped through non-linear activation functions mimicking human brain cells called [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron). Popular deep CNNs or ConvNets (such as [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet), [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [Inception](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf)) that are used for various [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) tasks have many of these architectural primitives (inspired from biology).  \n",
