Reusing knowledge from these previous runs will accelerate the hyperparameter tuning process, thereby reducing the cost of tuning the model and will potentially improve the primary metric of the resulting model. When warm starting a hyperparameter tuning experiment with Bayesian sampling, trials from the previous run will be used as prior knowledge to intelligently pick new samples, so as to improve the primary metric. Additionally, when using Random or Grid sampling, any early termination decisions will leverage metrics from the previous runs to determine poorly performing training runs. \n",

        "Additionally, there might be occasions when individual training runs of a hyperparameter tuning experiment are cancelled due to budget constraints or fail due to other reasons. It is now possible to resume such individual training runs from the last checkpoint (assuming your training script handles checkpoints). Resuming an individual training run will use the same hyperparameter configuration and mount the storage used for that run. The training script should accept the \"--resume-from\" argument, which contains the checkpoint or model files from which to resume the training run. You can also resume individual runs as part of an experiment that spends additional budget on hyperparameter tuning. Any additional budget, after resuming the specified training runs is used for exploring additional configurations.\n",
