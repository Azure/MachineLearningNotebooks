Each image is a handwritten digit of `28x28` pixels, representing number from 0 to 9. The goal is to create a multi-class classifier to identify the digit each image represents, and deploy it as a web service in Azure.\n",

        "3. Running: All scripts in the script folder are uploaded to the compute target, data stores are mounted/copied and the `entry_script` is executed. While the job is running, stdout and the `./logs` folder are streamed to the run history and can be viewed to monitor the progress of the run.\n",
