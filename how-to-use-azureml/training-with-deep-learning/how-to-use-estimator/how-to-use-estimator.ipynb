The name of the primary metric needs to exactly match the name of the metric logged by the training script and we specify that we are looking to maximize this value. Next, we control the resource budget for the experiment by setting the maximum total number of training runs to 10. We also set the maximum number of training runs to run concurrently at 4, which is the same as the number of nodes in our computer cluster."
