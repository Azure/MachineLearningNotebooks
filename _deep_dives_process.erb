##### How are topics chosen?
- EMs will solicit/remind team members to propose topics they'd like to see, which will be added as either a discussion on the Epic and/or as a newly created issue associated with the Epic.
- Team members can then upvote topics they'd like to see, which will determine priority. EM's will be the DRI for ensuring priority is set on topics.
- Optionally, team members can volunteer to lead deep dives, regardless of the priority.

##### How will a topic get scheduled?
- EMs will discuss the data, weekly or biweekly, that exists within the Epic as well as outstanding deep dive issues to solidify the priority order and schedule into appropriate milestones with due dates. EMs can then review potential assignments based on how useful the topic will be and who has capacity to lead the Deep Dive. 

##### Who is responsible for the completion of a deep dive?

- EMs will hold the assignee accountable to completing the deep dive, while the assignee will be responsible. 
- EMs are responsible for prioritizing and scheduling deep dives.

##### How do we maintain Deep Dives?

- Individual EMs can review existing Deep Dives to determine whether or not they should be updated or replaced. If so, they should be brought to the EM discussion and prioritized as a new Deep Dive.

##### Where can I find the deep dives?
